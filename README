  This is version 1.0 of Gchore.

Gchore is a simple tool that tracks your chores and reminds you to do
them on a daily basis. It is not a general todo list, but is better
suited for repeating tasks, such as taking out the garbage on
Mondays.

Another excellent use for gchore is for scheduled fish tank
maintenance.  You can set up gchore to remind you to do routine water
changes, vaccum the gravel, feed the fish, whatever, and it will
remind you via it's popups.

Gchore consists of a calendar, which displays the current month.
Double clicking on a day will allow you to add a task to that day.
you may also use the add/edit/delete task functions from the "Tasks"
menu above the calendar.  Preferences/options may be edited by
selecting File->Preferences.

Gchore is highly configurable, and many of it's features can be
accessed through the preferences popup.  One such preference is the
email option.  You can configure gchore to automatically email someone
when a task is completed, or send out an email at a scheduled time,
detailing what has been accomplished since the last email was sent.

The easiest way to start using gchore is to simply run it, and start
adding tasks.  It will automatically create all it's databases in your
home directory.  There is no need to move these, but you can if you
would like to.  Once you have added a task, gchore will start issuing
reminders to you via popup windows.  Once you complete the task, click
"completed", or if you don't feel like doing it today, click
"procrastinate".
